# Advent of Code 2020

It's advent of code time so I decided to upload my solutions to github. Not entirely sure how far I am going to get but hopefully I'll have the time to make it all the way through. A quick word of notice that although I try to solve things in a nice way sometimes things get messy trying to solve and if it works I'm not gonna go back and optimize stuff for these daily challenges.  

Everyday is stored in its own folder with the input for that day. Both problems are solved in the same program, some integrated together cleaner than others. I've decided to write things in Python because it is fun and quick.
